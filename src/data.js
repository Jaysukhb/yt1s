It is used by journalists and human rights organizations to save eyewitness videos, by educators to save videos for classroom use, by YouTubers to save backup copies of their own uploaded videos, and by users worldwide to watch videos on hardware that canâ€™t run a standard web browser, or to watch videos in their full resolution over slow or unreliable Internet connections. YT1s.com stands in place of a Web browser and performs a similar function with respect to user-uploaded videos. Importantly, YT1s.com does not decrypt video streams that are encrypted with commercial DRM technologies, that are used by subscription video sites." }
